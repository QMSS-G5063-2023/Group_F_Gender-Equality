## Project Description
Gender equality is an ongoing issue in the United States, particularly when it comes to employment and income. Despite progress in recent years, there is still a significant gap between men and women in terms of pay and job opportunities. Understanding the factors that contribute to this inequality is crucial for creating positive change.Our project aims to investigate gender-related discrepancies in the United States. The initiative will also seek to increase awareness of gender-related issues and identify areas where additional research and policy action are required. We generated attractive visualizations to identify patterns, trends, and insights regarding gender differences in the US.  We created four types of visualizations: static images with ggplot, maps using geospatial data, visualizations of text analysis, and network visualizations. This project brings together data from various sources to help us better understand the geospatial condition of gender inequality, how it has evolved over time, and case studies in two industries.

**1. Geospatial Map of Unemployment in the US by Gender in 2022**
Data: The gender-based unemployment data was obtained from the US Bureau of Labour Statistics in the following link https://www.bls.gov/lau/ex14tables.htm 
We are solely focusing on unemployment data from 2022 for each US state. This interactive map depicts the unemployment rates of each US state, with separate color coding for total unemployment and unemployment by gender. Darker shades indicate higher unemployment rates, while lighter shades correspond to lower unemployment rates.

**2. Differences in Employment in the US by Gender (Static Graph with ggplot)**
Here, we visualize the following: changes in unemployment rates in the United States over the last two decades by gender, changes in income over time by gender, and top 10 occupations for women.
 
**3. Case Study 1: Lazega Law Firm in United States (using Network Visualization)**
The social network graph has grouped the Lazega nodes using the Random Walk algorithm method to classify groups. Thereafter, the nodes are coloured by gender.

**4. Case Study 2: Differences in Gender Representation in Hollywood (using text analysis)**
Data: The data was originally from a study by FiveThirtyEight about gender representation in Hollywood. The datasets we used can be downloaded from the following Github repository https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-03-09  
We conducted text analysis of plot descriptions of movies to compare the use of words between American Hollywood films that have good and bad female representation. We used the Bechdel test as a measure of female representation, which looks at whether a movie has at least two named female characters who talk to each other about something other than a man. Movies that passed the Bechdel test are considered to have good female representation, while those that failed the Bechdel test are considered to lack female representation. By analyzing the plot descriptions, we aimed to understand how movies with good and bad female representation differ in the words they use. Even though the Bechdel test isn't the sole indicator of female representation in films, this analysis can provide insights into how women are portrayed in movies and how their representation can impact the way we perceive and value women in society. The datasets were obtained from a study conducted by FiveThirtyEight on Hollywood's gender bias.
